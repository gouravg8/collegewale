SEPARATE SECTION
1️⃣ Add “Admin Illusion” Features 
Even if they don’t need it technically:
“College Admin” label


“Manage Your Institution” wording


“Your Students” instead of “Students”


Language matters.
2️⃣ Add an “Activity Log”
Show:
Who updated what


Dispute protection


Council safety


3️⃣ Default Everything to Manual 
Avoid automation early.
Colleges trust what they control


Automation can come later


Manual systems feel safer initially


4️⃣ Add a “Help” Button That Doesn’t Annoy
Small


Non-intrusive


Opens simple instructions or video
